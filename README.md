## Introduction

Nightwatch.js is an integrated, easy to use End-to-End testing solution for web applications and websites, written in Node.js. It uses the W3C WebDriver API to drive browsers in order to perform commands and assertions on DOM elements.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a Selenium test framework written in Node.js and Nightwatchjs 1.5 with parallel testing capabilities. The Selenium test test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Selenium test tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

---

# On Premise

This infrastructure points to running the tests on your own machine using a browser (e.g. Chrome) using the browser's driver executables (e.g. ChromeDriver for Chrome). Selenium enables this functionality using WebDriver for many popular browsers.

## Om-Prem Prerequisites

-   For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), ensure that the ChromeDriver is downloaded successfully via node_modules

Note: The ChromeDriver version must match the Chrome browser version on your machine.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

-   How to run the test?

    To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

    ```sh
    yarn on-prem-single
    ```

    To run a specific test file, use the following command with the additional 'tag-name' argument:

    ```sh
    yarn on-prem --tag <tag-name>
    # for eg: yarn on-prem --tag user
    ```

    where, the argument 'tag-name' can be any tag configured in this repository.

    E.g. "user", "login" or any other tag as outlined in [About the tests in this repository](#About-the-tests-in-this-repository) section.

-   Output

    This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.

### Run the entire test suite on your own machine

-   How to run the test?

    To run the entire test suite on your own machine, use the following command:

    ```sh
    yarn on-prem-suite
    ```

-   Output

    This run profile executes the entire test suite sequentially on a single browser, on your own machine.

# Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open source platform that provides the ability to package and test applications in an isolated environment called containers.

## Docker Prerequisites

-   Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
-   Note: Docker should be running on the test machine. Ensure Docker Compose is installed as well.
-   Run `docker-compose pull` from the current directory of the repository.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on the docker infrastructure

-   How to run the test?

    -   Start the Docker by running the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose --project-directory docker up
    ```

    -   To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

    ```sh
    yarn docker-single
    ```

    To run a specific test file, use the following command with the additional 'tag-name' argument:

    ```sh
    yarn docker --tag <tag-name>
    # yarn docker --tag user
    ```

    where, the argument 'tag-name' can be any tag configured in this repository.

    E.g. "user", "login" or any other tag as outlined in [About the tests in this repository](#About-the-tests-in-this-repository) section.

    -   After tests are complete, you can stop the Docker by running the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose --project-directory docker down
    ```

-   Output

    This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser deployed on a docker image.

### Run the entire test suite in parallel using Docker

-   How to run the test?

    -   Start the docker image first by running the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose --project-directory docker up -d
    ```

    -   To run the entire test suite in parallel on the docker image, use the following command:

    ```sh
    yarn docker-parallel
    ```

    -   After the tests are complete stop the Selenium grid by running the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose --project-directory docker down
    ```

-   Output

    This run profile executes the entire test suite in parallel on a single browser, deployed on a docker image.

-   Note: By default, this execution would run maximum 2 test threads in parallel on Docker. Refer to the section ["Configuring the maximum parallel test threads for this repository"](#Configuring-the-maximum-parallel-test-threads-for-this-repository) for updating the parallel thread count based on your requirements.

## Observations

-   Do not use "." in the naming convention for any browsers or devices as it might break nightwatchjs' engine to start sessions or run them correctly.
-   There are few occurrences of `pause` method being used in some of the scripts as a temporary measure to avoid flaky test execution. We plan to remove all occurrences of these hardcoded `pause` methods in the upcoming patch releases.

## Open Issues

-   When running all the tests in parallel, there is some flakiness observed in mobile devices where in some commands are skipped or not executed at all.
-   Currently Nightwatch does not allow to control the maximum threads that should be spawned for tests running across different browsers in parallel. So when you run `yarn bstack-local-parallel-multiple` and `yarn bstack-parallel-multiple` commands, it will spawn 25 test sessions (5 spec files across 5 browsers).
